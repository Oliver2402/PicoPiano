# PicoPiano
This is a piano that utilizes a Raspberry Pi Piano and a piezo buzzer.
The piano works by taking shorts of pins to ground as inputs and playing a predefined frequency out of the piezo buzzer. It currently doesn't have a battery and there is no plan to add one any time soon.
If you want to build one I recommend watching this video I made explaining the process and in the description, there will be links to everything I've used: https://youtu.be/douf0n6V07s?si=IxmQRwuTHAQTCayb
